"""Plotting subsystem.

The plotting functionality is implemented as a set of mixins that are combined
into :class:`~flexpes_nexafs.plotting.PlottingMixin`. This keeps responsibilities
separated (styles, legend, interactions, pipelines, etc.) while allowing the
main UI class to inherit a single mixin.
