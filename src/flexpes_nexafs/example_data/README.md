\# Example data for flexpes-nexafs



This HDF5 file contains example FlexPES data for testing the GUI and

processing functions. It follows the standard FlexPES HDF5 file layout.



The data include O K-edge and Cu L-edge XAS spectra from various mixtures of CuO and Cu2O oxides.



The data channels (1d datasets) are:

* "b107a\_em\_03\_ch1" is TEY (total electron yield)
* "b107a\_em\_03\_ch2" is I\_0 photon intensity
* "b107a\_em\_03\_ch3" is PEY (partial electron yield)
* "pcap\_eegy\_av" is the photon energy
* "xspress3mini\_roi1\_dtc" is PFY (partial fluorescence yield)
* "xspress3mini\_roi2\_dtc" is TFY (total fluorescence yield)



Other channels are not relevant for this example.



In addition to the 1D datasets, the file also contains some scalar and textual metadata.
